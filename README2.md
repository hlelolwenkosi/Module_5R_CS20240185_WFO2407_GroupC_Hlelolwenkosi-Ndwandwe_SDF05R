Project Overview

This project is a simple, elegant web page design that includes a background color, text styling, and three unique button styles. The design aims to be clean and visually appealing while demonstrating various CSS techniques, such as animations, hover effects, and custom font usage.

Buttons
Three distinct button styles were created to showcase different CSS techniques.

Button 1 (btn-1)
Style: Black background with pink text.
Effects:
    Box Shadow: Adds depth with multiple shadow layers.
    Hover Effect: A glowing animation using @keyframes to create a gradient effect.
    Unique Feature: The ::before pseudo-element is used to create a colorful, animated border that appears on hover.

Button 2 (btn-2)
Style: Transparent background with black text and a pink border.
Effects:
    Box Shadow: Adds a subtle shadow for depth.
    Hover Effect: Changes text color to pink and a sliding black background appears from the left.
    Unique Feature: The ::before pseudo-element is used to create a background that scales horizontally on hover.

Button 3 (btn-3)
Style: Transparent background with a black border and text.
Effects:
    Box Shadow: Adds depth with multiple shadow layers.
    Hover Effect: Changes text color to pink and a black background expands vertically from the top.
    Unique Feature: The ::before pseudo-element is used to create a background that grows from the top, creating a half-circle effect on hover.

Challenges
Animation Timing: Ensuring the animations are smooth and visually appealing required tweaking the transition and @keyframes properties.
